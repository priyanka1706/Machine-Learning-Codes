# Machine Learning Codes
Python codes for implementing certain machine learning algorithms

## Algorithms 
The repository contains code for the following Machine Learning algorithms: 
- Linear Regression
- K Nearest Neighbours
- Support Vector Machine
- K Means Clustering
- Mean Shift

## Codes
The codes can be found as implementation of the algorithms from scratch, as well as some using other techniques like pickles, sklearn etc.
